# Data description

The dataset contains AlgoSeek Level 2 data from CME, CBOT, NYMEX and Comex. The Level 2 data is from the CME FIXFast feed which provides 10 levels of the book for the bid and the ask. The variables in the dataset are listed as below:
-	UTC: Timestamps in YYYYMMDDHHMMSSMMM in UTC time [MMM is for milliseconds] 
-	Ticker: Instrument name (up to 8 characters) 
-	Side: BUY/SELL side of the book 
-	Flags: is implied or regular book 
-	Depth: Number of levels being shown in the book for this instrument (up to 10 levels, zero-based index) 
-	10 levels of: Price x Contracts (Number of Orders). For example “1.38 x 12 (5)” means there are 12 contracts at price 1.38 from a total of 5 orders. Each row has 10 levels but there will only be data for the number of Depth levels (see depth field above).
